# Wanna contribute 🤝??

Flutter has given developers a super power to create innovative and creative UIs for Mobile and Desktop both 🦾😎. 

So why don't we create something awesome and contribute to Flutter community and also show the power or height of feasibility for creating beautiful things🤩 and if you want to contribute then you are at the right place☑!!

Here are the simple steps for contributing to this repo

  - **Fork the repo**
    
    First of all fork the repo to your own GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button on top-right corner. 
    
    After a sucessful fork, you'll see a copy of this repo in your own account.

  - **Clone the repo**
    
    Now it's time to copy this repo to own laptop/PC. 
    To clone the repo you can write the below command in **Git Bash**
    
    > git clone <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
    
    You can get the repo link from the Download section in the **repo copied in your own account**. 
    
  - **Set up remote repo**
    
      - When you cloned your fork, that should have automatically set your fork as the "origin" remote. Use git remote -v to show your current remotes. You should see the URL of your fork (which you copied in step 3) next to the word "origin". 
        If you don't see an "origin" remote, you can add it using below git command
    
        > git remote add origin <REPO_LINK_FROM_YOUR_ACCOUNT>
      
      - Now you have to setup **upstream**. For that write the below git command
      
        > git remote add upstream https://github.com/hutomosaktikartiko/flutter-awesome-animation
        
      - Now pull the latest changes from original repo to your local changes by firing thee below command
        
        > git pull upstream master
            
  - **It's Flutter Time now**
    
      - First of all, make a folder with named as your GitHub username and this is compulsory.

      - After that start writing code inside that folder only and you know what you have to code😉. Create anything you want using Flutter only!!

      - After finishing with the coding part, take snapshots of your creations or make a GIF if you have made any kind of animation✨✨. 
      
        Add the snapshot/GIF under the **Art-Work** section in the [README.md](https://github.com/clubgamma/Awesome-Flutter-Art/blob/master/README.md) in the same manner displayed in below image.
